# Development for CSE 121 C2
Theme: Command Line ASCII Animation

## Table of Content
- [Student Scaffold & Animator](#student-scaffold-animator)
- [Animation Options](#animation-options)

## Student Scaffold & Animator
There are two files we're concerned about:
- `ASCIIDrawing.java` is where students will write parameterized methods that returns
a String of an ASCII Art.
- `Animator.java` is going to call student's ASCII method and animate them.

## Animation Options
Currently, there's only one available animation available:
- An exploding ball

To run the animation, please use the following command: `javac *.java; java Animator`
